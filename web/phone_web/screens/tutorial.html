      Greeting, private. We will now give you quick rundown of how you can aid
      humanity's survival on this critical mission.
  </p>
  <p>
      The first thing you have to be aware about is the chain of command on the
      ship.

      Don't worry about your current position. There are plenty of opportunities
      to progress up the chain. Just do you best at your current role and you

      Now we will explain what your current role of a Crew member consists of.
  </p>
  <p>
      Once we are done with this explanation you will be given controll over the
      Targetting And Controll Operrating System (TACOS). It shows you the
      immediate area around the ship and allows you to take certain actions on
      objects near the ship.

      It is critical that you are aware aware of what each object displayed in
      TACOS represents. Here is a legend of the world view.

      The main feature of TACOS is that it allows you to take controll over an
      enemy ship and issue commands to it.
