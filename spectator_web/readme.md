The directory for the spectator web application.

Current plan is to have different <div> blocks for each screen (spectator, crew,
etc) that get shown or hidden based on the game state. As I have no web dev
experience this may or may not be a good idea. All functions dealing with
server communication are in coms.js. A lot of the functions are skeletons
and serve as a reminder for myself.
